### Linear Algebra
- **[Axler, *Linear Algebra Done Right*](https://linear.axler.net/)**: Focuses on operators and vector spaces; famous for avoiding determinants initially.
- **[Strang, *Introduction to Linear Algebra*](https://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/)**: Accompanying text for his famous MIT OCW course.
- **[Lay, *Linear Algebra and Its Applications*](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/linear-algebra-and-its-applications/P200000006338)**: Good standard introduction.

### Real Analysis
- **[Rudin, *Principles of Mathematical Analysis* ("Baby Rudin")](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Mathematical-Analysis-International-Mathematics/dp/007054235X)**: The classic, rigorous text. Notoriously concise.
- **[Abbott, *Understanding Analysis*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-2712-8)**: A more accessible and intuitive introduction than Rudin.

### Abstract Algebra
- **[Dummit & Foote, *Abstract Algebra*](https://www.amazon.com/Abstract-Algebra-3rd-David-Dummit/dp/0471433349)**: Comprehensive standard reference.
- **[Pinter, *A Book of Abstract Algebra*](https://store.doverpublications.com/products/9780486474175)**: Excellent, affordable (Dover) introductory text.

### Differential Equations
- **[Boyce & DiPrima, *Elementary Differential Equations*](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Elementary+Differential+Equations+and+Boundary+Value+Problems%2C+11th+Edition-p-9781119320630)**: Standard undergraduate text.
- **[3Blue1Brown (Differential Equations Playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNPOjrT6KVlfJuKtYTftqH6)**: Beautiful visual intuition.
